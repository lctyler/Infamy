Winston Crowley

18 year old Winston Crowley is a young conscripted infantryman in the Royal Army during the First World War. He knows little of war after growing up in rural Britain, but wants to do right by his country by serving proudly in the military. His romantic vision of war and patriotism carries him through the war, even as that vision rips apart at the SeAMS.

Synopsis

Winston Crowley is a veteran of World War I currently housed in a psychiatric ward in Britain. He is going through regular therapy to be rehabilitated back into society after the horrors of the Great War. Winston, however, remembers the war much...differently than most. You play as Winston Crowley, the 18 year old, as he battles through World War 1 in the form of flashbacks from Winston Crowley, the 28 year old, going through PTSD.
